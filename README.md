## Introduction

The project's objective is to gather job-related information from Instahyre using Python's Selenium library and organize it in a specified format. The collected data will then be converted into three separate tables: jobs, company, and details, utilizing the Pandas library. A search bar will be implemented using the Flask web framework to enable user-friendly searches, allowing users to look up skills. The search results will display essential details, such as the most common experience level, industry, company class where the skill is in demand, and the number of available job opportunities. To enhance the user experience, the FuzzyBuzzy library will be employed to correct any input errors made by users in the search bar.


## Problem Aimed to Solve:

1. Automate the job search process - Save time and effort.
2. Provide comprehensive job details - Rich information for users.
3. Enhance search query accuracy - Improve search results precision.
4. Analyze job market trends - Identify employment patterns and demands.
5. Increase job matching efficiency - connecting candidates with suitable positions.

## Methodology

The following methodology was used to accomplish the project objectives:

1. _Data Scraping:_ Job data was obtained from Instahyre using Python's Selenium library, considering specific criteria like job titles, locations, and company names.

2. _Data Conversion:_ Utilizing Pandas, the scraped data underwent a transformation into three tables: jobs, company, and details.

3. _Data Cleaning and Preparation:_ The data cleaning phase involved eliminating irrelevant data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, cleaning text, managing outliers, type conversion, consistency checks, categorical data normalization, and ensuring data integrity.

4. _Company Classification:_ Companies were classified into five classes (Class 0 to Class 4) based on employee count and company age using K-Means clustering. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method.
